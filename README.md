# Python based Hotel Management System
 This is a project made by me for service and room management in hotels. This is totally based on Python and SQL. I will try to add more functions to this later in the future

First we need to create database and tables for to store our data, that's why we have to run Creating Database(Room_Managmenent_System).py. This will create required database and tables on our database server.

Then, we can run Main Program.py. It has many features which are required to manage a hotel. In future I will try to add some more feature. Till then, enjoy :)

I have used these modules in these files, so kindly ensure that you have all of these modules installed in your PC:

mysqlconnector: Connects MySQL and Python and then we can use MySQL in python also. Module link: 
'''pip install mysql-connector-python'''

tabulate: This module helps to showcase results in tabular form in python: 
'''pip install tabulate''' 

For different types of table please refer this link: https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/

# Python based Hotel Management System
 This is a project made by me for service and room management in hotels. This is totally based on Python and SQL. I will try to add more functions to this later in the future

First we need to create database and tables for to store our data, that's why we have to run CreatCreating Database(Room_Managmenent_System).py. This will create required database and tables on our database server.

Then, we can run Main Program.py. It has many features which are required to manage a hotel. In future I will try to add some more feature. Till then, enjoy :)
